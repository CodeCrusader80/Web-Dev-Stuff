# Web-Dev-Stuff
 Repository in which many small pieces of code will be added regularly depending on a few effects that I manage to create.

 <h1 align="center">Galaxy</h1>
 <p>Galaxy created procedurally with Three.js which allows you to zoom within a constellation generated with a few hsaders and images in PNG format.</p>

 <h1 align="center">Liquid Particles</h1>
 <p>Particle simulator surrounded by two canvases, one of which has certain CSS properties and Javascript functions to give a "liquid" impression to the particles. The latter are also attracted to the click of the mouse.Work with HTML, CSS and JS only</p>

<h1 align="center">Scroll-Effect</h1>
<p>A sort of slider managed with Greensock, to create a sort of image effect within another image and which will therefore scroll as the mouse scrolls.</p>

<h1 align="center">Sphere</h1>
<p>This is a sphere that uses ThreeJS, WebGL and Greensock to be animated and react based on the user's mouse movement. A scaling effect is also managed by GSAP to give the impression of depth to the scene.</p>
