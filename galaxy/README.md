<h1 align="center">Galaxy in Three.js</h1>
<p>In this project, we will create a galaxy using threejs and some shaders to create a constellation representing the universe around us, in 3D of course and with the possibility of zooming inside to see certain stars in a crude way of course, therefore without apparent details.</p>
<p>Made using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd_VCToelw4">Seabass</a> tutorial</p>
